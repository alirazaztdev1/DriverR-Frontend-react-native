# DriverR Frontend (React Native)

The DriverR Frontend is a mobile application built using React Native, which provides a user-friendly interface for drivers to interact with the DriverR system. It allows drivers to manage their profiles, view job listings, apply for jobs, undergo verification processes, and receive interview feedback. The frontend communicates with the backend server to fetch data and send requests, enabling seamless integration with the DriverR ecosystem.

## Features

### User Authentication
- Allows drivers to register and create an account
- Provides a login and logout functionality
- Implements password reset and email verification processes

### Driver Profile Management
- Enables drivers to create and update their profiles
- Allows drivers to upload and manage their documents and certifications
- Displays driver ratings and performance metrics

### Job Listings
- Provides a list of available job listings
- Displays job details and requirements
- Allows drivers to filter and search for specific jobs
- Enables drivers to apply for jobs and track their application status

### Verification Processes
- Guides drivers through the verification process
- Collects necessary information and documents for verification
- Sends verification requests to the backend for processing

### Interview Management
- Notifies drivers about interview invitations
- Provides details and scheduling options for interviews
- Allows drivers to accept or decline interview invitations
- Displays interview feedback and ratings

### Notifications and Communication
- Sends push notifications to drivers for important updates and events
- Enables drivers to communicate with the admin or hiring managers
- Provides in-app messaging or chat functionality

### User Interface Design
- Designs an intuitive and user-friendly interface for mobile devices
- Implements responsive layouts and navigation components
- Follows mobile design guidelines and best practices

## Technologies Used

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications
- Expo: A platform for developing and testing React Native apps
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state
- React Navigation: A library for navigation and routing in React Native apps
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- Formik: A form library for building robust and flexible forms
- Yup: A library for schema validation
- Push Notifications: A service for sending push notifications to mobile devices
- Mobile UI Frameworks: Libraries like NativeBase or React Native Elements for UI components and styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Expo CLI (for development and testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone https://github.com/alirazaztdev1/DriverR-Frontend-react-native.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ````shell
   cd driverR-frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   API_BASE_URL=your-backend-api-url
   ```

   Replace `your-backend-api-url` with the URL of your DriverR backend API.

4. Run the application:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server and provide options to run the app on a physical device or an emulator.

## Usage

Once the frontend is running on a mobile device or emulator, drivers can use the DriverR app to register, log in, manage their profiles, view job listings, apply for jobs, and undergo verification processes. The app will communicate with the backend server to fetch data and send requests as needed.

You can customize the frontend implementation according to your specific requirements and design preferences. Modify the screens, components, and logic to align with your application's needs. Ensure that the API calls and data handling comply with the backend API specifications.
